# Jev Bush

> Jev Bush is a CPU-first probabilistic decision engine for DiffusionGemma.
>
> Please clap.

Jev Bush evaluates bounded OpenJev decisions directly from DiffusionGemma's
answer-slot logits. It never generates or parses free-form text. The engine is
one C11 file, [`jb.c`](jb.c), with no runtime dependency beyond the C
standard library; OpenMP is optional.

## Project goals

- Be a small, readable, educational implementation of direct probabilistic
  decisions on a real diffusion language model.
- Run inference on CPUs. GPU backends are deliberately out of scope: adding
  CUDA, Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU, or another GPGPU path would defeat the point of
  this project.
- Make the CPU path correct and fast through model-specific data layouts,
  vectorization, and OpenMP without turning `jb.c` into a generic framework.
- Remain compatible with OpenJev's bounded decision semantics and public
  evaluation data.

For production GPGPU inference, use
[OpenJev](https://github.com/razorback16/openjev) or
[SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf).

## Build

Linux, optimized for the current CPU:

```sh
cc -O3 -march=native -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fopenmp jb.c -lm -o jb
```

Portable Linux or macOS:

```sh
cc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic jb.c -lm -o jb
```

macOS with Homebrew LLVM/OpenMP:

```sh
$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic \
  -fopenmp jb.c -lm -o jb
```

Windows with MSYS2/MinGW-w64:

```sh
gcc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fopenmp jb.c -lm -o jb.exe
```

Run the dependency-free tests with `./jb --selftest`.

## Use

```sh
./jb MODEL_DIR decide request.json
./jb MODEL_DIR eval requests.jsonl
```

`MODEL_DIR` is either the public `google/diffusion-gemma-26b-it` BF16
checkpoint or NVIDIA's NVFP4 variant. It must contain `config.json`,
`model.safetensors.index.json`, `tokenizer.json`, and all referenced
safetensor shards.

The input is OpenJev's System One request shape:

```json
{
  "id": "case-1",
  "state": "A customer cannot sign in.",
  "questions": {
    "urgent": {
      "type": "noul",
      "instructions": "This needs action today.",
      "criteria": {"true": "Yes.", "false": "No."}
    },
    "route": {
      "type": "choice",
      "instructions": "Who owns it?",
      "criteria": {"billing": "Billing.", "technical": "Technical."}
    },
    "severity": {
      "type": "score",
      "instructions": "How severe is it?",
      "criteria": ["low", "medium", "high"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Decision semantics

Jev Bush reproduces OpenJev's bounded read:

1. Give each decision a one-token label in a fixed answer template.
2. Replace only those label slots with seeded vocabulary tokens.
3. Prefill the immutable prompt once, then run one bidirectional decoder read
   over the answer canvas using cached encoder K/V.
4. Project answer slots through the tied LM head and apply the checkpoint's
   `30*tanh(logit/30)` softcap.
5. Normalize only the declared candidate logits:
   `p_i = exp(z_i - max(z)) / sum_j exp(z_j - max(z))`.

Long choices use one-token labels rather than autoregressive string
likelihoods. Boolean values map to `yes/no`, ordinal scores to decimal
labels, and choices to stable alphabetic labels. Output contains every
candidate's probability and no generated text.

SHA-256 over Python-compatible canonical JSON seeds a Python-compatible
MT19937 canvas. Identical requests are deterministic. With no `samples`
field, OpenJev's entropy rule performs either one or four reads; `samples: N`
requests exactly `N` reads. Only `steps: 1` is supported.

## Exact model path

The code implements only DiffusionGemma's text path:

- memory-mapped BF16 or mixed BF16/NVFP4 safetensors;
- 30 Gemma 4 layers with mixed sliding/full attention, partial RoPE, GQA,
  dense FFN, and top-8-of-128 MoE;
- native packed E2M1 experts with E4M3 block scales for NVIDIA NVFP4;
- FP32 activations, portable scalar kernels, optional AVX-512 kernels, and
  OpenMP over independent work;
- cached causal encoder K/V and bidirectional answer-canvas attention;
- tied LM head and candidate-only normalization.

Unknown dtypes, tensor layouts, request shapes, and step counts are rejected.
There is no generic model framework, GGUF path, server, HTTP transport, image
tower, CUDA backend, or text generator.

## Reproduce the benchmark

The four scripts in `tools/` use only Python's standard library. Fetch the
pinned 400-row, 2,000-decision public set, run one deterministic read per
request, then report accuracy/calibration and timing:

```sh
python3 tools/fetch_openjev.py typed-decisions.jsonl

OMP_NUM_THREADS=32 OMP_PROC_BIND=spread OMP_PLACES=cores \
  python3 tools/run_openjev_eval.py ./jb MODEL_DIR typed-decisions.jsonl \
  predictions.jsonl --jobs 2 --samples 1

python3 tools/score_openjev.py typed-decisions.jsonl predictions.jsonl
python3 tools/summarize_eval.py predictions.jsonl
```

Give concurrent workers disjoint CPU sets when possible; otherwise separate
OpenMP processes may bind to the same cores. For lowest single-request latency
on the measured 64-core Threadripper 9980X, 48 threads was best.

## Established results

The trusted reference is OpenJev commit `91d5005` with patched vLLM commit
`9bbf7418`:

| engine and policy | accuracy | log loss | Brier | ECE | score MAE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Jev Bush BF16, one read | **67.40%** | 1.6134 | 0.3350 | 0.2523 | 0.4394 |
| OpenJev NVFP4, one read | 66.60% | 1.4747 | 0.3205 | 0.2446 | 0.4460 |
| OpenJev NVFP4, automatic reads | 66.80% | **1.3940** | **0.3107** | **0.2352** | 0.4404 |
| Jev Bush NVFP4, one read | 66.10% | 1.5476 | 0.3268 | 0.2540 | 0.4421 |

Jev Bush NVFP4 and one-read OpenJev agree on 92.70% of 2,000 argmaxes; mean
candidate-distribution total variation is 0.0765. The packed NVFP4 primitive
was independently checked against PyTorch: activation QDQ matched exactly and
checked expert projections differed by at most `2.4e-7`.

Two concurrent 32-thread Jev Bush workers averaged 10.11 s per row (p95
15.03 s), 65.60 prefill tokens/s per worker, 0.495 decisions/s per worker,
and about 14.8 GB resident memory per process. Candidate projection averaged
0.026 ms per decision; transformer execution dominates. OpenJev on an RTX PRO
6000 Blackwell averaged 54.2 ms per one-read row. Jev Bush is
accuracy-competitive, but not yet close to GPU latency.

The subsequent packed-activation kernel removes repeated even/odd lane
permutations from every NVFP4 expert output row. Six paired compact runs were
4.42% faster on average, and three paired 501-token runs were 4.06% faster,
with byte-identical probabilities. Reusing each activation load across two
expert output rows reduced the same 501-token request by another 5.24% across
three paired runs, also with byte-identical probabilities.

Current limits are batch size one per process, 4,096 prompt tokens, a 64-token
answer canvas, and one denoising step. The hypothesis is deliberately narrow:
bounded typed decisions should read candidate logits instead of paying for
autoregressive JSON generation.
